Hi I checked my ledger today and saw that there was a sell on my ETH. I am assuming that I pressed sell instead of buy, rather than assume that it was somehow hacked. But I can't seem to figure out where the money is if indeed it was sold. Is there a way that I can see where the money for this sell is?
