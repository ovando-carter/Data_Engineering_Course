# Question 1
# ----------
'''
a) Define a simple empty class called Vehicle.
b) Add an instance method called move() to the Vehicle class.
   Create an instance (object) of this class and call its move()
   method through its object.
c) Convert this class into an abstract class in order to use it
   as common interface (blueprint) for classes that represent
   different types of vehicles. What happens when trying to
   create an instance of this class? Why?
d) Create an empty concrete child class Aircraft that is derived
   from the class Vehicle. What happens when trying to create an
   instance of the class Aircraft? Why?
e) Include the method move() to the concrete child class Aircraft
   and that cpntains just one print statement displaying the
   message 'flying...'.
   Create an instance (object) of the class Aircraft and call its
   move() method through its object. 
f) Add another abstract method to class Vehicle, called
   accelerate(). Create an instance of the class Vehicle.
   What happens? Why?
g) Implement the accelerate() method in Aircraft class by
   displaying the message: 'reached 150 mph in 30 seconds'
   Create an instance (object) of the class Aircraft and call its
   accelerate() method through its object. 
h) Add a print statement to the accelerate() method of the Vehicle
   abstract class, displaying the message 'engine started...'.
   Call the accelerate method of the abstract class from the
   Aircraft child class before printing the message 'reached 150
   mph in 30 seconds'. See what happens and explain why.
i) Create another concrete child class Car that is derived from
   the class Vehicle and implements both move() and accelerate()
   methods. The move() method displays the message 'driving...'
   and the accelerate method displays the message 'reached 60 mph
   in 10 seconds'
   Create an object of classes Car and Aircraft, and call both 
   their move and accelerate methods. See what happens and explain
   the benefit of having the message 'engine started...' displayed in the
   abstract method accelerate().
j) Introduce an instance attribute called speed to the abstract
   class Vehicle and include property methods to read and modify
   its value (getter and setter). Declare these two property
   methods as abstract in order to enforce their implementation in
   every subclass of Vehicle. Create an instance of the Aircraft
   or Car class after adding the abstract property methods to
   their parent abstract class. What happens and why?
k) Implement the property methods to read and modify the value of
   instance attribute speed.
   Create an instance of the Aircraft and Car class after adding
   the abstract property methods to their parent abstract class.
   Modify the speed of both the aircraft and car objects.
l) Change the constructor to set the initial speed at 0 mph (once
   created, any vehicle is not moving), ensuring that every
   vehicle must have its initial speed set to 0 once created.
   Set the speed in the accelerate() method of both Aircraft and
   Car concrete classes to the speed displayed in the message.
   Test that it all works correctly by creating an object of both
   Aircraft and Car and doing the following for each object:
   - prints its speed
   - call its acccelerate method
   - print its speed
   - change its speed to some value above the one stated in the accelerate method
   - print its speed
   - call its move method

# Question 2
# ----------
'''
Add the class Hardware to the classes created in Module 2A Question 3
and make it parent of both HardDrive and Memory. Move the common
attributes and methods from the two existing classes to the
Hardware class. Then write the client code to do the following:
â€¢ All tasks listed under client code to test the HardDrive class in Module 2A question 3.
    In addition, check that:
    o the private instance attributes model and capacity are name-mangled to _Hardware__model and _Hardware__capacity, instead of _HardDrive__model and _HardDrive__capacity (by printing the object's namespace as soon as the HardDrive object is created)
    o model & capacity properties are now listed in the Hardware namespace instead of HardDrive namespace (by printing both HardDrive and Hardware namespaces as soon as the HardDrive object is created)
â€¢ All tasks listed under client code to test the Memory class in Module 2A question 3. In addition, check that:
    o the private instance attributes model and capacity are name-mangled to _Hardware__model and _Hardware__capacity, instead of _Memory__model and _ Memory __capacity but that speed is name-mangled to _Memory__speed (by printing the object's namespace as soon as the Memory object is created)
    o model & capacity properties are now listed in the Hardware namespace instead of Memory namespace, but speed property is still listed in the Memory namespace (by printing both Memory and Hardware namespaces as soon as the Memory object is created)
â€¢ create a Hardware object
â€¢ display the namespace of both the class and the object
â€¢ display the model and capacity directly from the object (ensure the getter gets invoked in both cases)
â€¢ set the value of model for the object to 'Dell' and the value of capacity to 4096GB (ensure the setter gets invoked in both cases displaying the appropriate message)
â€¢ display the values of model and capacity directly from the object (ensure the getter gets invoked in both cases and that the values of both attributes have not been changed)
â€¢ use the set_used_space method to change the used space to 500GB and check that it was changed by displaying the used_space attribute directly from the object
â€¢ set the docstring for the model to 'name of the hard disk model' and for the capacity to 'hard disk capacity', and then display them both
â€¢ delete the model, capacity and used space attributes and check their removal by displaying the object's namespace after each attribute is deleted

# Question 3
# ----------
'''
The class Hardware created in Module 2B Question 2 is generic
(relates to any hardware device) and should therefore not be
instantiable. Modify the class Hardware to make it abstract and
ensure that its subclasses HardDrive and Memory work as before.
Check that an attempt to instantiate the Hardware class
throws an error.
Note: although every hard drive and memory will always have both
memory and capacity attributes, not every hardware component
will necessarily have capacity, but it will always have the model.

Improve the classes Hardware, HardDrive and Memory created in Module 2B Question 3 by implementing the following:
â€¢ include the hard drive counter: count_hard_drive, storing the number of created hard drives
â€¢ include the memory counter: count_memory, storing the number of created memory components
â€¢ include the hardware counter: count_hardware, storing the number of created hardware components, where the hardware
  counter will always show the total of hard drive and memory counters
â€¢ increase the counters count_hard_drive and count_memory whenever a hard disk or a memory has been produced respectively
â€¢ include the increment_counter() method to the Hardware class to increase the class attribute count_hardware whenever a
  hard disk or a memory has been produced, and display a message: "New hard drive created" or "New memory created",
  depending on whether a hard drive or memory has been created
â€¢ include the print_count() method to print the number of produced Hardware, HardDrive and Memory components.

    The print_count() method in Memory class needs to print the number of produced memory components.
    The print_count() method in both HardDrive and Memory classes must be defined as class method, because 
    it accesses (displays) the value of class attributes count_hard_drive and count_memory respectively.
    Since print_count() method also needs to access the class attribute count_hardware to print the number
    of produced hardware components, it must be defined as class method in Hardware class as well, but it
    cannot be defined as abstract, otherwise its implementation could not be written in the Hardware class.
    The solution is to use method overriding - defining a method in the subclass which already exists in the parent class.
    By defining the print_count() method in all three classes, print_count() method in HardDrive
    and Memory classes will override the print_count() method in Hardware class: although
    inherited from Hardware, being re-defined in its subclasses, print_count() from Hardware will be ignored
    and print_count() from HardDrive and Memory classes will be used respectively in these classes instead.
    The print_count() method in each class will have its own message to be printed.
